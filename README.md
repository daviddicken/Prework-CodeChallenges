### Date 1/9/2021

### Instructions
Create a Console application that requests 5 numbers between 1-10 from the user. 
Output the array to the console and ask the user to select a number. After the selection, output the “score” of the number chosen.
Method needs to take in an int [] and a int if the users selected input.
The score is whatever number the iser selected * the number of times it is in the array.

### Approach & Efficiency
* Create a method to ask user for 5 integers to populate the int array.
* Check that input from user is a number between 1-10 before saving it to the array.
* After array is filled display list of numbers and ask user to select one to calculate score with.
* Check that number entered by user is in the int array
* Send array and number for score to ArrayMaxResult method.
* Create counter variable
* Step through int array and compare each int to number ented by user for score
* If they match increase counter by one
* Print number for score * the amount of times it was found in int array
